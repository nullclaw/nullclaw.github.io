# Deployment

This page remains as a compatibility entry point for old links.

Current deployment guidance is maintained in:

- [Quick Start](/chat-ui/docs/quick-start)
- [Operations](/chat-ui/docs/operations)
- [Development](/chat-ui/docs/development)

## Short Version

- build static assets with `npm run build`
- host `build/` on static hosting
- enable SPA fallback routing
- ensure users can reach a live NullClaw websocket endpoint
